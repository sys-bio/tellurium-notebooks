        "After fertilization, the *Drosophila* embryo enters a series of mitotic divisions without cytokinesis. During these cycles, the nuclear envelope is dissolved and DNA replication occurs rapidly. In this notebook, we include a series of models by **Calzone** et al. (2007) which provides a molecular model of these oscillations. We use this model as a benchmark for several reasons:\n",

        "Calzone et al. hypothesized that CycB, a major regulator of the cell cycle, is degraded locally in the vicinity of the mitotic spindle. To account for this, the model consists of a cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment. However, the nuclear envelope is dissolved during these mitotic cycles, so the nuclear \"compartment\" merely represents the region near the centrosomes. These compartments are represented by `nuclei` and `cytoplasm`.\n",

        "While the preceding model demonstrates mitotic oscillations, it left out an important detail: the phosphatase String. String regulates MPF and thus the cell cycle, and was assumed constant the preceding model. However, in reality, String levels do fluctuate. To account for this, Calzone et al. added terms for degradation and synthesis of String. Below, we have produced this model in COMBINE archive form. This archive reproduces both **Figure 1** and **Figure 3** of Calzone et al.\n",

        "In order to gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing the oscillations, Calzone et al. performed a one-parameter bifurcation analysis. They found that late cycles are controlled by the levels of Wee and String phosphatases, but early cycles are not. \n",
        "\n",
        "SED-ML does not support this type of analysis, so we cannot reproduce this part of the study exactly. However, we can verify the results independentling using time course simulations. We made the following changes to the model:\n",
        "\n",
        "* We removed all discrete events, and\n",
        "\n",
        "* We introduced the variable `C`, a cycle counter.\n",
        "\n",
        "With these changes, the model shows *stable* limit-cycle oscillations. We compare the limit cycle behavior of the original model to a model variant with reduced Wee and String activation and deactivation rates. The results show that the normal model exhibits stable limit cycle oscillations at both `C` = 1 and `C` = 12, the oscillations in the attenuated model are transient at late cycles (C = 12) but not at early cycles (C = 1), confirming the shift in regulatory mechanism to Wee and String at late cycles.\n",
