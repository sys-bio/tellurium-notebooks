        "In this notebook, we show examples of previously published models encoded using [Combine archives](http://co.mbine.org/documents/archive). The point of Combine archive handling in Tellurium is **not** to comprehensively reproduce all simulations in a manuscript. Instead, the point is to provide a starting point, e.g. a single simulation, that allows a user to import a model and validate that it is working. The user can then build more complex analyses on top of this starting point.\n",
